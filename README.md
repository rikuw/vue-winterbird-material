# Winter Bird Count

> VueJS single page application for viewing winter bird counts in Finland. Made with Quasar framework.

:exclamation: Only works with either the whole dist directory served from a server with   
the api/ files in root directory    
or with ``$ quasar dev`` and the api/ files served from a server, in which case the AJAX path   
must be set in Index.vue and Count.vue :exclamation:
